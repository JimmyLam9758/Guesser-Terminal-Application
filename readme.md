## Tests

I ran tests to test out two features of my game. The first feature I tested was the random word generator, I made sure it would generate a word as a string, and then take the length of the word and generate that value as in integer to use across the game. More details of tests in "test_functions.py" file </br>

Tests for my word generator, first test passes and 2nd and 3rd test purposely failed.
