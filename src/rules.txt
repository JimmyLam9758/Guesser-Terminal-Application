Once you enter '1', the game will begin. Once the game begins a random word will be randomly generated from a predetermined pool of words.
The length of the word will be given to you and you may begin inputting single letters to guess the word. Inputting 'exit' will exit the program
Whenever you make a guess and the letter is in the word, the blank space hiding the word will be filled in. Whenever an incorrect guess is made, 
your total remaining guesses will lower by 1. You will have a total of 7 incorrect guesses before you lose and the game is over. If you are having 
difficulties guessing the word, after a certain amount of incorrect guesses a hint will be revealed. Repeat the process of guessing letters until 
all letters in the hidden word has been revealed. Once all letters are revealed then you have won!!
